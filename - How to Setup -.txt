YT-DLP SIMPLIFIED COMMANDS  
By landn.thrn

A Command Prompt UI for YT-DLP, with simplified commands and configurations.  

Configured to download at the highest available quality video & audio always,  
with 36 different variations to download by.  
 
Video related commands download encoded to MP4 & MP3 by default for editor's use and compatibility with most applications    
If you wish to download non-encoded, then add `-orig` at the end of any command

You can easily change the command names if you'd like, it's as simple as renaming the command `.bat` files

If you already have `yt-dlp` and `FFmpeg` installed, then just point to their `.exe` folder path locations in the two config files

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INSTALLING YT-DLP & FFMPEG:

There's a number of ways you can do this. 
All of which work with these Simplified Commands of course, 
long as you point the path locations in the config files to the .exe's.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recommended Install of YT-DLP & FFmpeg:

—  Visit the YT-DLP GitHub Releases page:
   https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases

—  Install the latest `yt-dlp.exe`

—  Visit this FFmpeg Builds page:
   https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

—  Install the latest `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip`

—  Leave them in your download's for now

—  Create a folder in C:\ 
   name it whatever you want, `CleanPaths` are what the configs currently look for

—  Inside the folder you made, create a folder named `YT-DLP`

—  Place the `yt-dlp.exe` into the `YT-DLP` folder you made

—  Place the `YT-DLP Simplified Commands` folder into the `CleanPaths` folder or whatever you named it
   Make sure it's named just `YT-DLP Simplified Commands`

—  Place the FFmpeg .zip into the `CleanPaths` folder or whatever you named it

—  Extract the .zip, rename the folder it creates to just `FFmpeg` 
   (System PATHs have a max character cap out so it's best to keep them short if you can)

—  Delete the .zip if you want, no longer needed

—  Open the two config `.txt` files inside `YT-DLP Simplified Commands`, verify that the FFmpeg folder path address of the `ffmpeg.exe` is correct 

—  Windows search for Environment Varibles

—  System Properties will likely open so click Environment Varibles  

—  In the User Varibles top box select Path > Edit > New  

—  Paste the path addresses of the where the .exe's & .bats are held, if you followed the default they will look this
   C:\CleanPaths\YT-DLP
   C:\CleanPaths\FFmpeg\bin
   C:\CleanPaths\YT-DLP Simplified Commands

—  Click OK > OK > OK to save & close Environment Variables  

—  Open Command Prompt  

—  Type `dl-help`  

ENJOY :)
